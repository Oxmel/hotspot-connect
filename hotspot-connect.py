# Name : Hotspot Connect
# Author : Oxmel
# Version : 0.1
#
#
# Automates the authentication on a hotspot and keeps the connection alive
#
# Note that this script uses wpa_supplicant and has originally been made to
# run on a raspberry pi that is configured to emulate the behavior of a
# modem-router (see the script called 'pi-modem.sh' in my 'scripts' repo).
#
# In our case, the hotspots 'orange' are used to get an internet connection
# but the script can work with other providers like 'Free','Neuf', 'Fon',...
# Assuming you're running it on Raspbian, the authentication process is
# probably the only thing that would need to be rewritten.
#
# Since a lot of things can go wrong when trying to maintain a connection on
# that kind of hostpot, the script will regularly check for network errors
# or if a reauthentication on the captive portal is necessary.
#
# The main problems usually come from the APs themselves as the 'orange'
# hotspots may sometimes fail to give the client an ip address.
# If this happens, the faulty AP will automatically be blacklisted and
# wpa_supplicant will try to find another candidate in the vicinity.
#
# In other words, the more hotspots around, the less you are likely to
# completely lose the connection.
