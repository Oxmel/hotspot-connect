"""
    This module provides a set of tools to check the connection
    state and detect when a reauthentication on the captive portal
    is necessary.

    To achieve this, we mimic the method used by google on
    android. We make a call on a test url and verify the http
    code returned by the server.

    https://android.stackexchange.com/q/123129

    Since a lot of things can go wrong when trying to maintain a
    connection on that kind of hostpot, we also diag and attempt to
    fix the issue in case of network errors. Which is the trickiest
    part as many factors can influence the connection stability.
